Our project will leverage a combination of cutting-edge tools and frameworks to implement and enhance the Movie QA chatbot. 
We will utilize the Langchain framework, a powerful tool for interfacing with Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct chains of operations and autonomous agents.
LangChain will serve as the foundation for our QA chatbot, providing a flexible environment for seamlessly integrating various components of the project.

The GPT-3.5 model, a language model developed by OpenAI, will be a central component of our system.
We will harness the OpenAI API to interact with and deploy GPT-3.5, utilizing its advanced natural language processing capabilities to generate context-aware responses.

To implement the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) structure in our QA chatbot, we will utilize a vector database such as ChromaDB. 
Chroma will play a crucial role in efficiently retrieving relevant data from the dataset. 
The integration of a vector database aligns with the RAG approach, allowing our system to make informed decisions based on the contextual understanding provided by the vectorized representations of the data. 
This database will store vector representations of relevant information extracted from the textual corpus of movie or related documents. 
The vector database plays a crucial role in optimizing the retrieval process during recommendation generation.

This code defines a pipeline for a question-answering system with retrieval augmentation, named retrieval_augmented_qa_chain.
The design of this pipeline allows for the integration of external information to enhance the quality of responses to user queries.

Then we create a Synthetic Dataset For RAG Evaluation Using GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4:
To evaluate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines effectively using LangChain, you need to create a synthetic dataset with four essential components:

🤔 Questions: These are the prompts your RAG model will tackle. Make sure your dataset includes a diverse array of questions. This diversity tests the model’s ability to handle a wide range of topics and question complexities.
🎯 Ground Truths: These are the correct answers to your questions. You’ll use them as a benchmark to measure how accurately your RAG model responds.
🔮 Predicted Answers: These are the responses your RAG model generates. Your key task is to compare these answers against the ground truths to evaluate the model’s accuracy.
🌐 Contexts: These provide the necessary background or supplementary information that your RAG model uses to craft its answers. Understanding how your model leverages this context is vital for assessing its effectiveness in incorporating external information into its responses.


📊 Structuring Your Dataset
Organize your dataset in a tabular format. It should have separate columns for each element: questions, ground truths, predicted answers, and contexts. Each row in your table is a unique test case, comprising a question, its correct answer, the RAG model’s response, and the contexts involved.

🛠️ How to Use LangChain for Data Creation
You’ll use LangChain to generate realistic questions and contexts. Then, run these through your RAG model to get the predicted answers. Aim for realism and variety in your dataset to challenge your RAG model and thoroughly evaluate its capabilities.

RAG Evaluation Using ragas
Alright, let’s dive straight into the popular RAG metrics. Understanding these metrics is key to evaluating your RAG model effectively.

Here we go:
🎯 Answer Relevancy
What It Measures: This metric assesses how pertinent your RAG model’s answer is to the given prompt. You’re looking for answers that hit the nail on the head, not ones that beat around the bush.
Scoring: It’s a game of precision, with scores ranging from 0 to 1. Higher scores mean your model’s answers are right on target.

📚 Faithfulness
What It Measures: Here, you’re checking if the answers stick to the facts provided in the context. It’s all about staying true to the source.
Scoring: Also on a scale of 0 to 1. Higher values mean your answer is a faithful representation of the context.

🔍 Context Precision
What It Measures: This one’s about whether your model ranks all the relevant bits of information at the top. You want the most important pieces front and center.
Scoring: Once again, it’s a 0 to 1 scale. Higher scores indicate your model is doing a great job at prioritizing the right context.

✅ Answer Correctness:
What It Measures: This is about straight-up accuracy – how well does the answer align with the ground truth?
Scoring: Judged on a 0 to 1 scale, where higher scores signal a bullseye match with the ground truth.

In a nutshell, we’ve got four powerful tools to assess your RAG model. Each metric provides a different lens to view your model’s performance, from how relevant and faithful its answers are, to how precise it is with contexts and how correct its answers align with known truths.
